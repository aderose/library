# book listing app

This project focuses on the creation of an app to store information
about books the user would like to/has read.

A user can add books, remove them and update their read status.

This information is stored in local storage so the user can close
the webpage and revisit later without a loss of data. Data is not
accessible across multiple devices since local storage is not shared.
